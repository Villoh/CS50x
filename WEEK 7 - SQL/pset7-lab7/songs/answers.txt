If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

To characterize the audio aura of a listener based on their top 100 songs from 2018, we would need to consider the average energy, valence, and danceability of those songs.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

Song Selection Bias: The top 100 songs of a listener from 2018 might not necessarily encompass the full range of their musical preferences. It could be influenced by external factors such as popular trends, radio play, or algorithmic recommendations. Therefore, relying solely on these songs may not capture the listener's true audio aura.

Contextual Variations: The listener's mood and preferences can vary depending on different situations, environments, and timeframes. Limiting the calculation to the top 100 songs from a single year may not consider the listener's changing tastes and emotions throughout the year or in different contexts.

Subjective Interpretation: Energy, valence, and danceability are quantitative measures, but they might not fully capture the subjective emotional experience and individual interpretation of a song. Different people may perceive and respond to music differently, and these measures may not fully reflect the listener's unique emotional response to the music.
