Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations, 10 or 100.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I think that between 1000 and 10000 is the sweet spot, because the predictions are accurate enough and run time is good.
